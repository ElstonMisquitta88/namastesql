Note: please do not use any functions which are not taught in the class. you need to solve the questions only with the concepts that have been discussed so far.

1- write a query to get region wise count of return orders
SELECT 
		A.region,
		Count(1) OrderCount
FROM ORDERS A INNER JOIN  RETURNS B ON A.ORDER_ID=B.ORDER_ID
GROUP BY A.region


2- write a query to get category wise sales of orders that were not returned
SELECT 
		A.category,
		SUM(SALES) [sales of orders]
FROM ORDERS A LEFT JOIN  RETURNS B ON A.ORDER_ID=B.ORDER_ID
WHERE B.ORDER_ID IS NULL
GROUP BY A.category


3- write a query to print dep name and average salary of employees in that dep .
SELECT  
	B.dep_name,
	AVG(A.salary)[average salary]
from employee A INNER JOIN dept B 
ON A.dept_id=B.dep_id
GROUP BY B.dep_name

4- write a query to print dep names where none of the emplyees have same salary.
SELECT dept_id,count(dept_id)
FROM(
	SELECT  
		A.dept_id ,SUM(A.salary) Sumsalary
	from employee A INNER JOIN dept B 
	ON A.dept_id=B.dep_id
	group by A.dept_id,A.salary
)T group by dept_id HAVING count(dept_id)=1

5- write a query to print sub categories where we have all 3 kinds of returns (others,bad quality,wrong items)
SELECT 
		A.sub_category
FROM ORDERS A INNER JOIN  RETURNS B ON A.ORDER_ID=B.ORDER_ID
GROUP BY A.sub_category
having count(distinct b.return_reason)=3
order by A.sub_category

6- write a query to find cities where not even a single order was returned.
SELECT 
		 A.city,COUNT(B.ORDER_ID)
FROM ORDERS A 
LEFT JOIN  RETURNS B ON A.ORDER_ID=B.ORDER_ID
GROUP BY city
Having COUNT(B.ORDER_ID) =0

7- write a query to find top 3 subcategories by sales of returned orders in east region
SELECT 
	TOP 3 A.SUB_CATEGORY
FROM ORDERS A INNER JOIN RETURNS B ON A.ORDER_ID=B.ORDER_ID
WHERE A.REGION='EAST'
GROUP BY A.SUB_CATEGORY
ORDER BY SUM(A.SALES) DESC

8- write a query to print dep name for which there is no employee
select A.dep_name from dept A LEft join employee B on A.dep_id=B.dept_id where B.dept_id is null


9- write a query to print employees name for dep id is not avaiable in dept table
select A.emp_name from employee A LEft join dept B on A.dept_id=B.dep_id where B.dep_id is null
